### Tries on ClosureAgent in M$ Autogen for Multi-Agent / Multi-Message / Multi-Task Patterns

With ClosureAgent, it becomes really faster to prototype agentic systems and demonstrate ideas.

* enables focus on logic and business flows (closure handlers, data structures) without re-wrapping agent classes.

* supports customized message contexts tailored for specific tasks or topic-oriented handlers.

* leverages asynchronous message channels (queues, futures, streams, etc.) to bridge the user system with the agentsâ€™ sandbox environment.
